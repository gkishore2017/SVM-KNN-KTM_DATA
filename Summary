ðŸ§  Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing and comparing two fundamental machine learning classification algorithms: Support Vector Machines (SVM) and k-Nearest 
Neighbors (KNN). The objective is to analyze their performance on a dataset related to KTM (Kumaraguru College of Technology) data, which may include 
aspects like student performance, attendance, or other academic metrics.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Objectives
Preprocess and clean the KTM dataset to ensure suitability for modeling.
Implement SVM and KNN classifiers using Python.
Evaluate and compare the performance of both models using appropriate metrics.

ðŸ§° Methodology
Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values and normalized features to prepare the data for modeling.

Model Implementation:
Utilized Python libraries such as scikit-learn to implement SVM and KNN classifiers.

Model Evaluation:
Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings
Both SVM and KNN models were successfully implemented and evaluated.
Comparative analysis provided insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm in the context of the KTM dataset.
